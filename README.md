# HELLO

I'm working my way through the [Udemy - Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/) and am using this repo to practice git workflows as well.

## FEEDBACK

I'd love it. I'll do my best to refactor my code as I learn, but I'm intent on finishing this course, so if I miss anything, please leave feedback via issues or messages.
